{% include base_path %}

When I was 21, I had never really traveled before.  My senior year, I passed up the chance to spend a semester at the University of Utrecht in The Netherlands because I had burned through all of my scholarship and I didn't want to take on any debt.  Yeah.  No debt.  Anyway, so I went ahead and graduated, but I didn't bother with the normal interview process.  No, a buddy of mine and I headed west.  To Jackson Hole, WY.  To make a long story short, I learned really quickly that travel can be a source of great happiness and great regret...and often time these things do not have to be very far removed from one another.

So, that was the beginning.  It's been 25 years since then and priorities have changed wildly.  Back then, I'm not sure if things could have gotten much better than camping on the Oregon Coast with my buddy, James Brown, a little bit of moonshine, and a lot of rain.  These days, well, getting that upgrade to the penthouse in Barcelona was pretty tight.  But I still like camping, and so do my kids.

Don't let the "flip-flop" fool you, though.  I can be downright obsessive about planning travel, and I have sort of a hard time letting go of the process.  I will spend obscene amounts of time to make sure that we are going to the right places, staying in the coolest digs, seeing what we should see when we get there, and not paying too much for any of it along the way.  It's not that everything has to be perfect.  I'm just looking for that inflection point...where the price point crosses the cool or unique factor.  I'll be writing about everything from interesting hostels to luxury villas.  So maybe it's more about practicality and making the most of limited time.  Hope you enjoy it.  Feel free to drop me a line
