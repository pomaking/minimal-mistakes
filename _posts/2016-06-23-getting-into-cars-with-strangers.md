I'll start this blog by dipping the pen in some pretty dry ink.

Like many people, I just wasn't ready for a job at Enterprise or Wachovia when I was getting ready to graduate from Appalachian State.  My buddy Robb, a good friend and fellow rugby player, was in the same boat.  We had both spent a fair bit of time on the slopes of North Carolina over the course of our educational pursuits, however his family had also done him the courtesy of introducing him to the delights of western skiing.  A gap year in the Rockies was in order.

I had been sitting on some certificates for cheap-ass plane tickets, courtesy of the American Express student plan I had at the time.  Somehow, I was able to actually use one of those for a flight into Jackson over fall break.  If I had a budget for this trip, it would have been just shy of zero.  The planning for the trip amounted to borrowing my roommate's rucksack and a sleeping bag, then looking at a map of where the town was in relation to the airport.  Yeah.  And I think the "map" was part of a printed brochure, not exactly to scale.

The plane landed in Jackson late, the last flight in that night.  It's a long walk from the airport down the access road to Highway 191.  Looking back now, through the lens of Google Maps, the plan doesn't seem like such a bad idea.  I was going to walk up 191, take a left onto Teton Park Rd and double back down Moose-Wilson Rd to Teton Village.  It would have been a 13 mile walk, probably with wildlife encounters along the way, although I had no idea of this at the time.  There was a hostel in the village, though, so I would have had a cheap bed waiting for me.

The problem was that I was doing this without Google Maps, or a map of any kind.  And it was dark.  And I completely missed the turn for Teton Park Rd, which meant I was heading straight for Yellowstone National Park, about 60 miles away.

After seeing literally nothing for an hour and a half, except the most beautiful sky I had ever seen and the first shooting stars of my life, I was starting to rethink my decision.  I turned around and started heading back towards the airport, even though they had literally been turning the lights off behind me.  I have no idea what time it was when I finally got back to the airport...I'm guessing 1:30 or 2 AM.  I was tired and starting to consider stepping off into the brush and unrolling the sleeping bag.  

The headlights rolled up behind right about the time I hit the access road.  It was an old VW Rabbit Diesel, one of the old VW diesels with no fake emissions and a boatload of black smoke coming out of the tailpipe.  The car was a shade of brown that I can't imagine anyone found appealing, although it could have been bright pink by that time of night and I wouldn't have know any different.  I could not have been happier to see it stop.

The fellow in the driver seat cranked the window down - definitely no power windows on this puppy - and politely asked if I needed a ride.  I was nine miles from the town of Jackson with no money to speak of and nowhere really to go, so I jumped in. 

His name was Corey.  He explained that he had gone up to Yellowstone to meet some friends, although I've never been sure if I'm remembering this correctly or not.  He was just a kid, really, maybe 18 or 19 years old.  He had recently moved out there from Tampa and was working at the Jackson Bootlegger.  Young Bundy.  We hit it off instantly - no, not like that.  The way you do when you're traveling.  Jackson is full of transients.  Even those living there are typically temporary.  Few are lucky enough to make it their permanent destination.  

Before we made it into Jackson, he had offered the spare room in his apartment for my stay in Jackson, just a couple of blocks from the base of Snow King Resort.  This would turn into our apartment for the winter when Robb and I moved out there permanently after graduation, Christmas holiday, and, unfortunately, the bulk of the snowfall for that winter.

So, the yin and the yang, the good and the bad.  Fly out to Jackson to look for a place to live with no plans, no place to stay, and no money.  Walk the wrong direction in the middle of the night and find exactly what you're looking for, a place to stay for the winter and a lifelong friend to boot.
